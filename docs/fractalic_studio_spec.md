### 1.3. Problem section

**Section title**

> The real AI problem isn’t tools. It’s chaos.

**Copy**

Most companies are in one of three states:

- Teams are experimenting with random AI tools, but nothing is standardised or measured.
- Vendors sell "AI solutions" that look impressive in demos and disappear in operations.
- Leadership feels the pressure to "do something with AI" without a clear map, budget, or owner.

The result: noise, duplicated effort, no ownership, and no link to revenue, cost, or risk.

### 1.4. What Fractalic Studio does

**Section title**

> We turn AI noise into a controlled system.

**Short paragraph**

Fractalic Studio is a boutique advisory focused on one thing: making AI deployment legible and controllable for the people who actually own the business. No magic, no vendor lock‑in, no buzzword decks.

**3 pillars**

1. **Diagnosis** – We map where AI can actually move numbers in your business, given your model, team, and constraints.
2. **Design** – We shape concrete workflows, roles, and guardrails where AI makes sense – and cut what doesn’t.
3. **Delivery support** – We stay close while you run pilots, adjust the design, and turn experiments into operating routines.

### 1.6. How we work

**Section title**

> How it works

**Steps**

1. **Intro call (30 minutes)** – You share context and constraints. We ask direct questions. If there is no meaningful value to create, we say so.
2. **Proposal** – Clear scope, timelines, fees, and decision points. No hidden upsell.
3. **Work** – Short cycles, written artifacts, and explicit owners on your side.
4. **Exit on purpose** – We design ourselves out. The goal is not dependency; the goal is a system you own.

### 1.7. Who we work with

**Section title**

> Who Fractalic Studio is for

We work best with:

- Founders and CEOs of companies between 5 and 150 people.
- Businesses with real revenue and repeatable work, not just slides.
- Leaders who are willing to make decisions about focus, not chase every AI trend.

If you want inspirational keynotes or a chatbot on your homepage, we are not the right firm.

### 1.8. About Fractalic Studio

**Section title**

> About Fractalic Studio

**Copy**

Fractalic Studio was created for founders who think in systems and are tired of vague AI promises.

Our background is in strategy, operating models, and power structures inside organisations: who actually decides, who owns which outcomes, and how processes hold under stress.

We bring that lens to AI. Tools matter, but only inside a clear frame of authority, responsibility, and measurement.

## 2. Design Recommendations for the Website

Goal: a modern, sober, AI‑literate consulting site that signals clarity, control, and depth – not spectacle or gimmicks.

### 2.1. Overall aesthetic

- Clean, spacious layout with strong typography and minimal decoration.
- No stock‑photo robots, brains, glowing circuits, or “futuristic” clichés.
- Visuals should feel closer to a serious strategy firm than to a SaaS landing page.

### 2.2. Layout

- Single‑column or 2‑column layout with generous margins and whitespace.
- Max width for text around 70–80 characters per line for readability.
- Clear visual hierarchy: hero → problem → what we do → services → how we work → about → contact.
- Sticky top navigation with subtle background when scrolling.

### 2.3. Typography

- Use one primary sans‑serif family with multiple weights (e.g. Inter, Neue Haas Grotesk, SF Pro, similar).
- Distinct sizes:
  - H1: bold, 40–54px desktop, 28–32px mobile.
  - H2: 28–36px.
  - Body: 16–18px.
  - Small meta text: 12–14px.
- Avoid playful or display fonts. The feeling should be precise, not loud.

### 2.4. Colour

- Base: near‑white or very light grey background.
- Text: almost‑black, high contrast.
- Accent colour: one strong but restrained accent (for links, buttons, subtle lines).
- Error/warning states and system messages can use a secondary accent, but keep the palette short (3–4 functional colours total).
- No gradients, neon glows, or heavy glassmorphism. If you use depth, keep it subtle (soft shadows, fine borders).

### 2.5. Imagery and graphics

- Instead of AI stock imagery, use:
  - simple schematic diagrams of flows and decision paths;
  - abstract but minimal “fractal” or grid motifs that suggest structure, not magic;
  - screenshots or simplified representations of real deliverables (maps, roadmaps, process diagrams), anonymised.
- Use vector graphics or line‑based icons; avoid skeuomorphism.
- If photography appears, let it be:
  - documentary style (real work settings, whiteboards, documents), not staged corporate smiles;
  - desaturated or in a consistent mild grade to avoid noise.

### 2.6. Interaction and motion

- Micro‑interactions only where they help orientation (e.g. link underlines on hover, subtle card lift, smooth anchor scrolling).
- If you use animation:
  - keep it slow and minimal;
  - no looping, distracting effects;
  - use it to explain a concept (e.g. simple flow from “chaos” to “structured system”), not to “look advanced”.
- Page load should be fast; avoid heavy libraries and unnecessary visual effects.

### 2.7. Structure for responsiveness

- Mobile‑first thinking:
  - Stack sections clearly; collapse navigation into a clean menu.
  - Preserve spacing; don’t compress everything into a wall of text.
- Tablet / small laptop:
  - Two‑column grids for services and “how we work” steps.
- Desktop:
  - Use wide layout but keep text columns narrow; side space can carry small patterns or notes.

### 2.8. Signals of trust and seriousness

- Clear footer with:
  - company details (legal entity, at least country and city);
  - email and possibly a calendaring link;
  - privacy and terms links.
- If you have them later: logos of clients, anonymised case snapshots, or short quotes.
- Use consistent date and number formatting; avoid sloppy microcopy.

## 3. Brand Philosophy & Logic (English, no clichés)

### 3.1. Role of Fractalic Studio

Fractalic Studio is not a tool vendor and not an inspiration factory.  
Its role is to help the people who own a business keep control while they adopt AI.

That means:

- clarifying who decides what,
- aligning AI work with existing power and responsibility,
- refusing to introduce technology that no one will own or maintain.

### 3.2. Why “Fractalic”

A fractal is a pattern that repeats at different scales.  
For the brand, this means:

- the way we think about a company at the level of vision is consistent with how we design a single workflow;
- decisions at board level and decisions inside a team follow the same logic: clear purpose, clear rules, clear owners, explicit consequences.

Fractalic is the commitment to that structural consistency.

### 3.3. Core thesis

- AI is not a strategy. It is a set of tools and capabilities.
- Strategy lives in power: who sets direction, who allocates resources, who carries consequences.
- AI only becomes an asset when it is embedded in that power structure: in processes, roles, and metrics that someone is accountable for.

Therefore:

- we start from structure and authority, not from features;
- we design AI use so that leaders remain in charge, not sidelined by vendors or internal experiments gone rogue.

### 3.4. Principles

1. **No hype.**  
   We do not promise transformation, disruption, or “reinventing your business”.  
   We commit to specific changes in how work is done and measured.

2. **System over tools.**  
   Tools are interchangeable. The system – processes, roles, decision rights – is what matters.  
   We design for replaceable tools inside a stable frame.

3. **Authority first.**  
   Every AI workflow has an owner.  
   If there is no clear owner on the client side, we treat the initiative as a risk by default.

4. **Explicit trade‑offs.**  
   Every recommendation comes with what it will cost: time, attention, political capital, and maintenance.  
   We surface those trade‑offs so leaders can say “yes” or “no” with open eyes.

5. **Measured or removed.**  
   If an AI initiative cannot be meaningfully measured in terms the business cares about (revenue, cost, risk, time), it should not outlive an experiment.

6. **Exit built in.**  
   We do not design dependence on ourselves.  
   We build documentation, decision logs, and simple governance so the client can run the system without us.

### 3.5. Brand voice and tone

- **Direct, not aggressive.**  
  We say what we see without drama.

- **Concrete, not mystical.**  
  We avoid phrases like “unlock potential”, “reimagine”, “supercharge”.  
  We speak in terms of: processes, people, numbers, risks.

- **Analytical, but human.**  
  We acknowledge that power, fear, and ego exist in any organisation and design with that in mind.

- **Responsible.**  
  We do not outsource the consequences of our advice to “the market” or “the future”.  
  If a recommendation is fragile, we say so.

### 3.6. Application in practice

In every engagement we check ourselves against the brand logic:

- Are we reinforcing the client’s ability to govern their own AI use, or creating a new dependency?
- Are we making the organisation more legible (who does what, why, with which tools), or less?
- Are we respecting existing constraints (budget, people, politics), or pretending they don’t matter?

If the answer drifts in the wrong direction, we adjust the work or decline the scope.

Fractalic Studio exists to make AI adoption a governed process under clear authority – not a wave of experiments that nobody owns.
